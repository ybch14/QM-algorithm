# QM algorithm

This is a course project of Digital Circuit and CPU course of Department of EE., Tsinghua University.

The algorithm is implemented in C++. ```QM.cpp``` is a version without STL and ```QMnew.cpp``` and ```QMnew2.cpp``` is with STL. ```QM.cpp``` does not work.```QMnew2.cpp``` works well with Depth First Search. But the execution time might be very long when boolean functions are too long (maybe one million).
